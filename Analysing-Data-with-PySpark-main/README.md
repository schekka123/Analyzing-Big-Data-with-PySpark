# Analysing-Data-with-PySpark
I chose The History of Tom Jones book because it is a comic book and because the storyline—a  man being adopted into a wealthy family—piqued my interest.

### Steps involved are as follows: 

Created a project in Jetstream and created a VM instance 
Created an image of PySpark and done all the setup 
Created a workspace SparkWork and created notebook in that workspace 
Installed Spark and PySpark 
Replicated and worked on given example file and statements 
Later, explored History of Tom Jones file from the given list of files 
Performed PySpark commands and got to explore the data, it’s words and counts 
Removed StopWords using NLTK methods 
Calculated the top and bottom ten words and the frequencies 
Visualized the top and bottom ten words and their frequencies
